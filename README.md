hello-world
===========

A GitHub repo not containing anything of interest.

Actually it does. It now contains a "random" number generator. As in, it always prints the same number that I was randomly thinking of when writing the code.

Or actually, it generates a different 8-bit number everytime now! It's 
even more random than before YAY WOOHOO WOOT  : D  : D  : D  I rule just 
admit it I rule now I'm gonna conquer the world

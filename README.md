hello-world
===========

A GitHub repo not containing anything of interest.

Actually it does. It now contains a "random" number generator. As in, it always prints the same number that I was randomly thinking of when writing the code.

Or actually, it generates a different 8-bit number everytime now! It's 
even more random than before YAY WOOHOO WOOT  : D  : D  : D  I rule just 
admit it I rule now I'm gonna conquer the world

I also have a directory here as a dumping place for crazy ideas which will probably not work, but which still feel potentially genius enough to make them publicly available to people who might want to do something with them.
If you want to use one of my ideas, please read the [guidelines](crazy_ideas_which_probably_will_not_work/USAGE_GUIDELINES.md) for that first.

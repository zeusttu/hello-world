So, it seems you have found my repository of crazy ideast which probably will not work.
Great!
Feel free to use them if you wish to.
I would like you to be aware of a few guidelines in doing so:

* These ideas are free to (try to) use for everyone and anyone, in any way possible or conceivable, as long as the laws of their country/city/whatever do not say otherwise.
* If you (try to) use any of my ideas and decide to go public about what you are doing and/or about your findings, I would appreaciate some kind of attribution.
  This is however not a requirement, and I understand that it can get especially complicated in situations where you can only credit people by their real names (since I avoid using mine on the internet).
  When possible, I will generally prefer attribution to my internet name over attribution to my real name.
  Please contact me if you feel that you do need to use my real name.
* Feel free to contact me if you are using, trying to use or even just considering one of my ideas.
  I would love to hear about all the cool things you want to do with them!
  Also feel free to contact me if anything is unclear and you think I have the answer needed to help you forward.
  Keep in mind that I will often not have that answer though, as I will probably have done less research than you have.
* If you want me to take an idea down, for whatever reason, please contact me.
  This might e.g. be because someone else came up with it before me (please forgive me for not doing enough research to find it).
  I may or may not ask you to back up your claims with e.g. a timestamped publicly available record of the idea that was created before I committed and pushed my version of the idea.
* If, for similar reasons, you want me to credit an idea (but not necessarily take it down), contact me as well.
  I will probably quite easily give you the benefit of the doubt as long as you give me something to link to.
* Except in cases outlined by the previous two guidelines, please respect that other people are allowed to use my ideas just like you are, and please refrain from trying to limit that by e.g. patenting or copyrighting my ideas.
* Have fun with my ideas and do cool things! 8^D

These are guidelines, not an official license written in legally waterproof language.
If you are evil, you will easily find a way to violate all of them within the boundaries of the law.
I have faith in the majority of you to be nice and keep to these guidelines though :)

If you need to contact me, you might have to clone this repository locally to find out my email address in the commit log.

My idea for cold fusion
=======================

I have a tendency to occupy my mind with unattainable things. And so it happened that I was contemplating cold fusion this morning.
Rather than reporting the conclusions of that, I will take you through my entire train of thought.
It should be noted that I only considered hydrogen-hydrogen fusion during this contemplation.

I started pondering what could be the mechanisms behind regular atomic fusion in a plasma.
I know this is probably something physicists have long figured out, but I decided I'd be able to keep a more open mind if I didn't look up the consensus on the subject, so I decided to go purely by my own imagination.
I know that nuclear fusion occurs when two atomic nuclei get so close together that the attractive strong nuclear force gets bigger than the repulsive electromagnetic force between the two positively charged nuclei.
I came up with two hypotheses regarding how these might get so close together in a plasma:

* Nuclei in a plasma can move around freely and have a lot of thermal energy, enabling them to build up considerable momenta in random directions, which may be enough to get them within reach of one another for nuclear fusion.
* Both nuclei and electrons move around freely and randomly in a plasma. Occasionally a relatively large number of electrons will come close together in between two nuclei, drawing both of those nuclei nearer with an electromagnetic force bigger than the nuclei's mutual electromagnetic repulsion.

In a cold fusion scenario, nuclei and electrons won't move around nearly as freely and will have only a fraction of the thermal energy they have in a plasma.
This immediately rules out anything resembling the former mechanism from working in a cold fusion scenario.

The latter, however, could *maybe* work in a way, albeit within a molecule.
I don't really know the electron orbits within a hydrogen molecule, but I imagine there *might* be a localised orbit in between the two nuclei, which can support both of the molecule's electrons if they are excited to the right energy level.
Based on [Falstad's ionic hydrogen orbital viewer](http://www.falstad.com/qmmo/), the "sigma g 2pz" orbit looks like a good candidate for this.
I'm not sure if the same orbital exists for a second electron which would turn it into a molecule, but I would presume it does, albeit at a higher energy level due to electrostatic electron-electron repulsion.
Exciting both electrons to that orbital would in turn be possible with a laser of the right wavelength (possibly dual wavelengths are needed due to the different energy levels for exciting the first or one more electron).

There are a lot of unknowns in this. Also a lot of things which probably *are* known to people within the right fields, but not to me.
And there's a lot of speculation in here.
I don't have the expertise to tell whether or not this could possibly work, but someone probably does.
I am guessing that this probably will not work, because probably someone before me thought of this, tried to work it out and found that it will never work.
But I cannot be sure of that, so I decided to broadcast my idea to the world anyway :)
